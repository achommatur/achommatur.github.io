    <h2>DESCROPTION</h2>
    <p>Mochi is a Japanese dessert. The gooey, 
        scrumptious 'dough' surrounds the
         filling, and is rolled into a little ball.
         You can color the dough with food coloring, 
         if desired.</p>
         <p>Eat mochi as is or fill with whatever you
           want (e.g. peanut butter, red bean paste,
               etc.) Enjoy! </p>  
    <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>glutinous rice flour(mochiko)</li>
        <li>water</li>
        <li>white sugar</li>
    </ul> 
    <h4>STEPS</h4>
    <ol>
     <li>Mix rice flour and water together in a bowl;
         add sugar.Mix dough until no flour spots are 
         present.
     </li>   
     <li>Place a dough boiler over simmering water;
         steam until dough is very got and very sticky, 
         about 15 minutes.
     </li>
     <li>Working quickly, remove dough from double boiler
         with a spoon or spatula and set on work surface 
         floured with rice flour. Knead dough with your 
         rice floured hands, adding more flour as needed 
         so mochi dough doesn't stick to your hands anymore.
     </li>
     <li>Divide mochi into 6 to 8 pieces, about the size
         of a ping pong ball.
     </li>
    </ol>
