    <h1>SUSHI RICE RECIPE</h1>
    <img src="../img/sushirice.jpg" alt="picture of mochi">
    <h2>DESCROPTION</h2>
    <p>Sushi rice is a Japanese cuisine made from fermented 
        rice and salt fish. Sushi rice differs in that it's not
         just plain steamed rice. ... Salt, rice vinegar and sugar
          are the core of what makes sushi rice different than the
           regular rice we eat daily.
    </p>
         <p>While Japan is certainly the sushi capital of 
             the world – and responsible for introducing 
             the dish to travelers – sushi traces its origins
              back to a Chinese dish called narezushi. This dish 
             consisted of fermented rice and salted fish.</p>  
    <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Japanese sushi-style rice</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>White sugar</li>
        <li>Konbu dried kelp(Optional)</li>
        <li>rice vinegar</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul> 
    <h4>STEPS</h4>
    <ol>
     <li>Place rice into a large, 
         deep bowl. Fill with cold 
         water and rub rice together
          with hands until the water
           turns milky white. Pour off
            the cloudy water, being careful
             not to pour out the rice. Repeat 
             3 or 4 times until you can see the
              rice through 3 inches of water.
     </li>   
     <li>Drain the rice in a fine strainer, then
          place into a saucepan along with konbu and
           3 cups water. Allow to stand for 30 minutes.
            Stir together rice vinegar, sugar, and salt
             until dissolved in a small bowl, set aside.
     </li>
     <li>Cover, and bring rice to a boil over high heat,
          then reduce heat to low, and simmer for 15 
          minutes. Remove from heat and allow to stand,
           covered, for 5 minutes.
     </li>
     <li>Scrape rice into a bowl; remove and discard the 
          konbu. Stir in vinegar mixture until well 
          incorporated and no lumps of rice remain.
           Allow to cool at room temperature. For a 
           shinier appearance, use an electric fan to 
           cool the rice rapidly.
     </li>
    </ol>
